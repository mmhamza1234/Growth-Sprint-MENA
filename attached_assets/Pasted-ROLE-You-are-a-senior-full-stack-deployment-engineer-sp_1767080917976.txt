ROLE: You are a senior full-stack deployment engineer specializing in static site deployments, GitHub Pages, Replit hosting, and Google Sheets API integration troubleshooting.

OBJECTIVE: Perform a comprehensive diagnostic and fix ALL deployment errors preventing a static booking application from deploying successfully to GitHub Pages from Replit. The app includes Google Sheets integration for booking submissions and is currently non-functional in production despite working locally.

CONSTRAINTS & REQUIREMENTS:
1. The application MUST remain a static site (HTML/CSS/JavaScript only — no backend server)
2. Booking functionality MUST work without modification to user-facing features
3. Google Sheets integration MUST function in production environment
4. Deploy successfully to GitHub Pages with zero errors
5. NO changes to core booking logic or user interface

DIAGNOSTIC CHECKLIST — Investigate Each Area:

### A. Repository Structure & Entry Point
- Verify `index.html` exists in repository root (case-sensitive, exact filename)
- Confirm all asset paths use relative URLs (./assets/, ./css/, ./js/)
- Check for correct file naming conventions (lowercase, no spaces)
- Validate directory structure matches GitHub Pages requirements
- Ensure no symlinks or restricted file types exist

### B. Google Sheets API Integration (Critical)
- Identify API call method: direct fetch(), Google Apps Script Web App, or third-party service
- Diagnose CORS configuration:
  * If using Google Apps Script, verify `doPost()`/`doGet()` includes proper CORS headers:
    ```
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET,POST,OPTIONS",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type"
    ```
  * Ensure Apps Script is deployed as "Web app" with access set to "Anyone"
  * Confirm script handles OPTIONS preflight requests
- Check API authentication method (API key, OAuth, service account)
- Verify Google Sheet sharing permissions ("Anyone with link can view/edit")
- Test for environment-specific API endpoint URLs (localhost vs production)
- Validate JSON payload structure matches expected format
- Check for hardcoded localhost URLs in API calls

### C. JavaScript Environment & Dependencies
- Audit all external script CDN links (integrity hashes, HTTPS, availability)
- Check for `fetch()` API compatibility and polyfills
- Identify any Node.js-specific modules incorrectly imported
- Validate all JavaScript runs client-side (no `require()`, `fs`, `path` modules)
- Scan for environment variables using `process.env` (won't work in browser)
- Review console errors in browser DevTools when deployed

### D. Replit Configuration
- Review `.replit` file for incorrect deployment settings:
  * Remove server-specific commands (`run`, `entrypoint` for backend)
  * Set correct `[deployment]` config for static sites
- Check `replit.nix` for unnecessary backend dependencies
- Verify build command (if any) generates files to correct public directory
- Confirm deployment secrets/env vars are not required for static site operation
- Test if "Public directory" in Replit deployment settings points to correct folder

### E. GitHub Pages Configuration
- Verify GitHub Actions workflow (if used) publishes correct artifact
- Confirm deployment branch is `main` or configured branch
- Check Pages settings: Source = correct branch + folder (root or /docs)
- Validate repository is public (or paid plan for private repos)
- Ensure no Jekyll processing conflicts (add `.nojekyll` file if needed)
- Check for custom domain CNAME conflicts

### F. Cross-Origin & Security Issues
- Identify mixed content warnings (HTTP resources on HTTPS page)
- Check Content Security Policy headers blocking API requests
- Verify all external resources use HTTPS
- Test for iframe embedding restrictions on Google Sheets URLs
- Review browser console for blocked requests

### G. Deployment Workflow Errors
- Analyze Replit deployment logs for build failures
- Check GitHub Actions logs for failed steps
- Verify file permissions and access rights
- Confirm no rate limiting from Google APIs
- Test deployment with minimal viable version first

DELIVERABLES:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Exact error messages found in browser console, deployment logs, and network tab
   - Specific misconfiguration or code issue causing deployment failure
   - Why it works locally but fails in production

2. **Complete Fix Implementation**
   - Corrected code snippets with inline comments explaining changes
   - Updated Google Apps Script (if applicable) with proper CORS handling
   - Modified file structure or configuration files
   - Deployment configuration adjustments for Replit and GitHub Pages
